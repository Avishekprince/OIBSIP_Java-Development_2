# OIBSIP Java Development - Task 2: Number Guessing Game

##  Objective
The goal of this project was to create a simple **Number Guessing Game** in Java.  
The computer randomly selects a number, and the player tries to guess it within limited attempts.  
Hints are provided after each guess until the player wins or loses.

##  Steps Performed
1. Used **Scanner** class for taking user input.
2. Used **Random** class to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
3. Implemented a loop that allows the user to guess up to a maximum number of attempts.
4. Displayed hints such as:
   - "Too High" if the guess is greater.
   - "Too Low" if the guess is smaller.
5. Added validation for wrong inputs (non-integers, out of range).
6. Calculated total rounds and total score.

##  Tools Used
- **Java (Core Java)**
- **JDK 8 or later**
- **VS Code / Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA**

##  Outcome
- Successfully implemented a console-based game where the user interacts with the system.
- Learned the usage of loops, conditional statements, and random number generation.
- Improved understanding of handling **user input** and **program flow control** in Java.

##  How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
